# ðŸ“ž Fraud Call Detection using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is built to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to detect **fraudulent calls**, such as cases where criminals impersonate police officers or law enforcement officials.  

The notebook implements the process using **Google MediaPipe Model Maker** with a structured dataset. It explains the end-to-end workflow from dataset preparation to prediction.

## ðŸ”§ Block Diagram (Conceptual Flow)

**System Flow:**
1. **Dataset Collection** â†’ Gather fraud and genuine call samples.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** â†’ Clean and prepare data for training.  
3. **Feature Extraction** â†’ Use MediaPipe to generate embeddings.  
4. **Model Training** â†’ Train classifier on fraud vs genuine samples.  
5. **Evaluation** â†’ Validate the trained model.  
6. **Prediction** â†’ Classify new/unseen samples as Fraud or Genuine.

## âš¡ Code Flow Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**  
   - Load all required libraries (TensorFlow, MediaPipe, NumPy, etc.).

2. **Dataset Loading**  
   - Dataset organized into folders:
     ```
     dataset/
       â”œâ”€â”€ Uniform/
       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train/
     ```

3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Normalization and data preparation.  
   - Train/validation/test splits created.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Model built using MediaPipe Model Maker.  
   - Classification head trained to distinguish between **fraud** and **genuine**.

5. **Prediction**  
   - The trained model is used to make predictions on unseen data.
